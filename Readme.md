---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-backend.git
cd task-manager-backend
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Apply Migrations

Run the following commands to set up the database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Create a Superuser (Optional)

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

---

## Start the Development Server

Start the Django development server with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
